## Instructions

This is a frogger clone arcade game. The game starts automatically once the index.html page is loaded.<br>

The player controls their character using the arrow keys. Lead your character past the bugs up to the safety of the river. The left and right edge of the field will warp the player to the other side. Touching the bugs will return the player to the start.
